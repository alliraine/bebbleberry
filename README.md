# BebbleBerry
A BeepBerry Launcher and UI Framework using a PebbleUI-esc design. 

There are two main goals for this project:
- First, to make a user friendly interface so ANYONE can use a beeperberry.
- Second, make a launcher that any developer can build their own apps. Ideally I would love to see a future app store created for easy installation.
